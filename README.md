## Homework 4
Purpose: Train a convolutional neural network on MNSIT data and then apply transfer learning to a set of hand drawn letters (A through E). We compared letters drawn on lined paper vs cleaner images drawn directly on a touch screen laptop. As expected, the cleaner images had a higher validation accuracy.
